# Conway’s Game of Life
Conway’s Game of Life is a computer simulation created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It runs on a grid where each cell is either alive or dead. The game follows simple rules to decide how cells change over time.
## Rules:
A live cell dies if it has fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors.<br />
A live cell stays alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbors.<br />
A dead cell comes to life if it has exactly 3 neighbors.<br />
## Starting the Game:
Random Patterns: The grid is filled with live and dead cells randomly.
Custom Patterns: You pick which cells start alive<br />
## What Happens Next?
Once the game starts, the grid updates automatically, and the pattern evolves based on the rules. Some shapes stay the same, some repeat in cycles, and some expand endlessly.
